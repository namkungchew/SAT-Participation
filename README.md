## Executive Summary


This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the factors that affect SAT (and its biggest competitor ACT) Participation Rate during 2017 and 2018 in the United States. It also seek to track the effect of the new format for the SAT released in Mar 2016 in increasing SAT Participation Rate and recommends where money is best spend to further improve it. In the report, we investigate similarities and differences in SAT and ACT through participation rate, scores data Our findings shows that SAT and ACT are certainly in direct competition for market share. There are 2 main populations who will take the tests. First population will take the either of these 2 tests to use it as part of their college application requirements. This population will only take the tests if they will they can do well in it and if they intended to apply for college. The second population took the test as to fulfill the federal requirement for 'No Child Left Behind' for high school students. This is a bigger population which the first population is a subset of as all students not just the ones that intend to go to college have to take. The new format have been effective in helping SAT established itself as meeting the requirement as a test for the second population and helped the College Board to successfully win new contracts with the education administration of the states of Colorada, Illinois, Rhodes Island etc to make it as the go to test for the federal requirement in that state. We recommend that the College Board continue with this strategy as it have been very effective in increasing particpation in SAT and that to target Tennessee next.
